Nerve wrecking, ball splitting action!

Nerve Ball -- "Do my balls get on your nerves?"

A simple ballgame with a neural network guiding system modulating the trajectories of the balls.
- click on balls to divide them to smaller balls.
- the smaller the ball, the bigger the score.
- the smallest ball does not divide, but disappears and player gains one minute play time.

The audio in the game is generated by a simple 8-voice FM syntheziser.
