Nerve wrecking, ball splitting action!

Nerve Ball -- "Do my balls get on your nerves?"

A simple ballgame with a neural network guiding system modulating the trajectories of the balls.
- click on balls to divide them to smaller balls.
- the smaller the ball, the bigger the score.
- the smallest ball does not divide, but disappears and player gains one minute play time.

The audio in the game is generated by a simple multitimbral FM syntheziser.

To build them balls, you need CMAKE.

```
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
```
